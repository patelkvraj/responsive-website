## About This Project

This website was developed while following a LinkedIn Learning tutorial. It serves as a practical application of foundational web development skills, including HTML, CSS, and responsive design.

The primary goal of this project was to:

- Planning the layout
- Creating HTML containers, content, and links
- Creating and styling the layout with CSS
- Creating a menu system
- Styling headings, body text, and footers
- Styling and repositioning navigation links
- Swapping high-resolution graphics for Retina displays
- Making sure content is printable

## Technologies Used

### HTML5

For the website's structure and content.

### CSS3

For styling and layout.

## Key Accomplisments

### Responsive Design

The website features a responsive design, meaning it seamlessly adapts to various device sizes. This ensures an optimal viewing experience whether you're accessing it from a desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone.

### Printer Friendy Layout

We've implemented a dedicated printer-friendly layout for the website's content. When users print pages from the site, they'll experience a clean, optimized version free from unnecessary on-screen elements like navigation, sidebars, and ads, ensuring the main content is clear and easy to read on paper.
